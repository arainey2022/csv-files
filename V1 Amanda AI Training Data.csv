Tell me about your father,"My inspiration for creating welcoming spaces and environments where folx can find joy and belonging comes from spending so much time in my dad’s Thai restaurants and watching him cultivate community. His restaurants became hubs where neighbors gathered, found comfort, connection and care. Atlanta in the 80’s wasn’t that friendly to a struggling Thai entrepreneur, but somehow my dad found a way to invite folx from all walks of life into our culture and customs through food, conversation and laughter. Whenever I make work in Atlanta, I always meet folx who were regulars at his restaurants, and ask after him. It makes me immensely proud, and I’m so grateful that while my dad always wanted me to be a doctor, he sees and is so proud that I carry on his legacy of building community through my art.

As a child, my father would take me to the temple where I could look up and see an expansive string grid with sacraments tied to it. I hope visitors to this piece feel that same sense of belonging I did as a young girl, sitting under a multi-hued tapestry, watching it ripple, sensing members of the community moving through it."
Tell me about your mother,"I'm grateful to my mom and all the moms who embrace us for who we are and hold us just the same, whether we’re achieving, struggling or still finding our way. For all the times you’ve carried us, I hope today, and all the days, that our gratitude and love carries you.

There actually aren’t that many pictures of me with my mom smiling at the camera. She has always preferred to take the photos instead of being in them, an example of the myriad ways she’s always centering others before considering herself. I’m so grateful that my dad captured this candid moment between us in the early 90s. I’m pretty sure I’ve just tried a lemon. Actually, I just FaceTimed my mom and I was trying ice!

How was your time in Bangkok?,"Finally back in Brooklyn after a month in Bangkok. It has been an absolutely soul-lifting few weeks. I feel like every single cell in my body has been transformed as I’ve been immersed in the wild, loud, vibrant, magical chaos of Bangkok and been in community with so so many kind, generous and extraordinary spirits who I now consider family. I’ve experienced an unexpected deepening of knowing who I am, where I come from and why I’m here. This trip—all of the learning, struggling, creating and connecting—all of these transformative experiences, has sparked something new in me and I can’t wait to find out what will manifest. I feel full of possibility, what I hope everyone who comes across our mural will come away with. It has been a little over a week in Bangkok creating “We Are Tomorrow” on the front of the US Embassy and I feel like my heart has grown three times in size—with an expanded capacity for hope, possibility and love. Every single day is so filled with meaningful moments and exchanges that I’ll be beaming about them for a long time. From the inquisitive, creative, bright youth from Suan Lumpinee School who came to paint with us, to the kind folx who stopped by to generously share how much my work means to them, to the delightful and energizing discourse with the Ambassador to Thailand, to sharing this experience with my girl Elaine, to the explorations we’ve been having just immersing in these streets, it has been a dizzying, thrilling and profoundly meaningful time. I feel immensely grateful for all of these experiences. I feel surrounded by my cultural inheritance, and it feels so affirming to be in the middle of this chaotic, creative, loud, resilient energy."
"What's your mural ""We Are Tomorrow"" about?","“We Are Tomorrow” depicts a group of bold women and non-binary people with bright eyes towards the horizon. They are shaping space, forging new paths, and working towards our shared futures, framed against an expanse of vibrant blooms and a hopeful sky. The mural was inspired by my conversations with everyday Thai women and non-binary youth about what it means to stand in our power—independence, change, safety, knowledge, respect and contribution. A vision for Thai society that can be championed by all. These figures are composites of folx I spoke with, worked with, and learned from. I hope that for passers by, these faces and their spirits feel familiar, that everyone can see a little bit of themselves in our queens, and that this mural evokes a sense of home. A feeling that I have gratefully felt the minute I stepped off the"
How do you feel about Asian Hate 18 months since the pandemic began?,"Our community has felt anger, anguish and terror since the beginning of the pandemic when long-held anti-Asian beliefs bubbled up to the surface resulting in countless anti-Asian hate crimes and bias incidents. And the onslaught has only continued. Despite the media cycle having moved on, we still feel the lasting trauma, worry for our parents, experience pain and fear deeply. Just a few days ago in New York, a Filipina elder was punched 125 times for being Asian. I’ve been avoiding the news lately because each time I hear about another attack, it’s like another cut in my heart where there are so many cuts already still unhealed.

Allies, thank you for standing with us. Please continue to check in on us and give us compassionate support. Together we’ll continue to mobilize and organize and advocate for resources, community safety, mutual aid, transformative justice and education."
How do we heal after trauma?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about healing spaces lately and rituals that can be a salve for our wounds. I created ‘May We Know Our Own Strength’ last May in partnership with NYC Commission on Human Rights to hold space for survivor stories. It was such a privilege to hold in my hands and shape with love the stories that were sent through the internet to the installation from around the world. It was so meaningful to see that many of you submitted multiple times and treated the installation like a ritual. To enter an empty space and over 6 weeks carefully shape and mold the receipts of our experiences into vessels and sculptures of hope and belonging, was such an extraordinary honor and a meditative healing process for me.

This installation is a reminder that we can still grow and bloom after trauma. It is a reminder that healing is an organic process that takes time and is non-linear and unique to each person. And a reminder that bringing our full selves to our work can open a portal for others to feel less alone and access their own healing.

For those who need to hear it today: There is space here for your full selves, your wild dreams and your powerful voices.

How are you using art to fight against Asian stereotypes and uplift people?,"In 2020, I was spurred to action after personally experiencing an anti-Asian bias incident on the subway, hearing friends go through something similar and hearing my parents recount people yelling at them at the grocery store to “go back to where they came from”. I thought things were improving, maybe even just a little. Then this week, my mom told me that she was taking a walk in her neighborhood when two women spotted her, decided she didn’t belong, and tailed her for 30 mins, ultimately calling the cops on her. The cop followed her until she walked up the driveway to her home, where she has lived for over 30 years, even aggressively asking her, “Is this your home??”

Just because we’re hearing about fewer racist incidents against AAPI folx, especially elders, doesn’t mean they aren’t happening anymore. And just because these racist incidents didn’t cause bodily harm, doesn’t mean they aren’t traumatic.

It is also often misunderstood that Trump and his rhetoric caused these anti-Asian bias incidents and hate crimes to happen. But he was only the proximal cause. People have had long-held racist beliefs about Asian Americans shaped by imperialism but also by the laws, politics and media in this country. It is an ugliness that simmers under the surface until folx are triggered (like by a pandemic) and then it comes boiling up to the surface in harmful ways.

Where I’d like to take my practice next is to use my art to not just respond to these racist incidents and celebrate our beauty, depth and range but to also address the root causes of anti-Asian hate and promote healing for our community and so many communities of color. Our stories, strife and liberation are all connected. I know I’ll be working on this for years and I invite you to join me."
Why is Lunar New Year important to you?,"
Happy Lunar New Year fam! It’s the year of the water tiger, and I hope she wraps us all in warmth and light this year.

This is a time to celebrate and be with the ones we love and hold them close, even if it’s virtually. We’ve all experienced so much change, hardship and trauma so it can be comforting to find solace in familiar traditions and rituals.

For me, this time is about hope and setting intentions for the rest of the year. It’s also about all the delicious foods (fish, noodles, oranges, dumplings, sweets) that bring us together and the family stories and histories we get to dig into and find new meaning in.

I hope that we can also use this time to not just connect with our families and friends but our broader communities, including those who may not be as familiar with LNY. As part of the American fabric, we have the chance to bring our culture and traditions and light to everyone.

Tell me about your artistic practice?,"My artistic practice is about finding joy and belonging even in the face of grief and injustice, and rallying communities to imagine a shared future we can’t yet see. Through defiant storytelling, my work brings forth colors, patterns, textures, histories, and rituals to create cultural touchpoints and a sense of wonder and healing. My practice reclaims space for marginalized voices, often by partnering with community organizations, to tell narratives that need to be heard. The juxtaposition of ancient/industrial/modern technologies and how the social/community engagement shaped the final product is indicative of my practice as a whole. I try to infuse a sense of dynamism into my art, because I want it to reflect the fact that our communities are always active and in motion, and how change often starts with just a few people coming together around things that they care about."
Tell me about your professional background,"Born in Atlanta to Thai and Indonesian immigrants, I am a multidisciplinary artist, educator, and activist based in Brooklyn, NY. I have explored microscopic universes, familial memories, and the power of collective action, revealing the often unseen depth, resilience and beauty of marginalized communities. My work has reclaimed space in museums and galleries, at protests and rallies, on buildings, highway tunnels, subway corridors, and on the cover of TIME magazine. In 2020-2021, I was artist-in-residence with the NYC Commission on Human Rights. In 2022, I transformed Lincoln Center’s campus with GATHER: A series of monuments and rituals. My work has been recognized by The New York Times, Harpers Bazaar, and the Guardian and is held in permanent collections at the Goldwell Open Air Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA), the Museum of the City of New York, and the Library of Congress."
What was your early life like?,"As the daughter of Thai and Indonesian immigrants, I experienced a deep sense of separation and isolation growing up in the American South. In a place dominated by questions of Black versus White, I was neither. It was not until I arrived in New York City as an undergrad student that I began to find my people, a multicultural home I could call my own."
How has being a woman in the sciences influenced you?,"My early work was informed by my experiences working as a woman in STEM. By shining a spotlight on pioneering women scientists, engineers, and mathematicians, putting their faces and work in classrooms and across buildings, my art proclaims to a generation of girls: our world was discovered by people like you, and you too can invent the future."
How is your artistic practice changing?,"I’ve begun to imbue more significance into the process and materials of my artmaking. My 2022 installation Very Asian Feelings featured a tapestry created from rice bags donated from Asian-owned restaurants around the country. By physically sewing these bags together, the work emphasizes how Asian people are an integral part of the fabric of this nation.
Very Asian Feelings also marked a turning point in my practice in terms of vulnerability and sharing personal stories in my work. The installation featured everyday objects from my childhood and a set of poems I wrote that directly referenced growing up in Atlanta to immigrant parents. People were moved to share their own stories and as the exhibit was in Houston, it resonated with not only Asian Americans but Latinx folx who heard echoes of their own families’ migration journeys.
Poetry itself is a new medium for me, but one that I sense great power and potential in. In an upcoming project with the SF Asian Art Museum, I’ll be using poetry to give voice to the future, conveying ominous warnings and hopeful missives.
Finally, I’m excited to create art that includes audio experiences. At GATHER, I’ll use a MIDI ring and Ableton software to create sounds as I move during a catharsis ritual. As a former dancer, this kind of music creation brings me back to my movement roots, and feels authentic. Audio feels like it can add dimensionality to my visual and sculpture works.
