Write me a detailed and long bedtime story,"A mom’s job is never truly finished—Elise knew this instinctively when her son was born. For at least the hundredth time, she sat next to his bed in that chair mending his quilt. There was no way of knowing, the day she bought it at a flea market, that it would become her son’s most valued possession. 
To call it a quilt stretched the definition as it was nothing more than a thousand pieces of oddly shaped swatches stitched together, layer after layer, until the whole of it was thick enough to hold in the warmth of a small boy's body as he drifted off to sleep. The person who pieced together this labor of love must have spent countless hours shaping the useless remnants into a usable blanket. Elise felt it was her duty to repair the inevitable rips as an homage to the unknown creator and as a manifestation of her adoration for the little boy who cherished it.
“I love how cool it feels when I first get into bed,” her little man observed the first night he wrapped himself in the old quilt. “But before long, it warms up, and I’m snug as a bug in a rug. Where did you get it?” 
The question was one whose answer was too mundane to inflict on a wide eyed little boy, so Elise stretched the truth just a little. “It was brought over on the Mayflower by the Pilgrims,” she answered to her son's delight. “It’s made from pieces of fabric from all over Europe and is the first blanket used by the first Americans.”
It was just a little white lie, but it was also the beginning of a cherished tradition. As stitches unraveled and as tears ripped the quilt and the little boy's heart, Elise sat by his bed and mended the heirloom. Then she would continue the ""true"" story of how the quilt had found its way to her son. 
“During the Revolutionary War, your quilt was captured by General Cornwallis and used to keep his legs warm on the cold winter nights.” Elise said, weaving a story as intricate as the blanket itself. “It wasn’t until the surrender at Yorktown that it was returned.”
“Yorktown?”
“Yes, Yorktown,'' she said smiling, “George Washington took it from Cornwallis and used it during his eight years as president.”
“You mean my blanket has been to the White House?” 
“Of course it has,” Elise answered with a wink. “But not because of George Washington, silly. John Adams was the first president to live in the White House.”
“Who then, Mom? ``The little boy asked., “Who took my blanket to the White House?”
“That’s a story for later,” Elise replied, kissing her son on his forehead. “Now you get some sleep, and I’ll continue the story next time.”
Elise, unfortunately, had far too many opportunities to continue the blanket’s tale as her son was given to debilitating headaches. At first, the doctors thought he was prone to systemic migraines, but the truth was much worse. Many nights, too many, the little boy would curl up in pain, his teeth clenched in a faux smile. The headaches were excruciating, only soothed by a cold wash cloth, his mother’s gentle voice, and the telling of the quilt’s tale as he drifted off to sleep. 
There were also many a night where Elise would sit with her son as he slept, meticulously piecing back together the tears that threatened the blanket entirely, wishing there was a way she could also mend her son. The room would be completely quiet save for the sound of Elise’s song. It was something she had done since she was his age. Inadvertently yet intentionally she would let the air slip through her lips, creating a tune just for him that would live for that moment, replaced the next time by one equally beautiful and equally unique.
“As it turns out, the first time the quilt made it to the White House was just after Abraham Lincoln was elected president,” Elise said the next night, continuing the story from where they’d left off. The pain had become more frequent and more intense, requiring more chapters more often. The story's continuation, however, had the desired results, a distraction and a smile.
“Abraham Lincoln, he used my quilt, too?” her son asked, too young to doubt his mother. 
“Of course he did,” Elise responded, tickling her son just to hear him laugh. “It’s a little known fact, but Mount Rushmore was actually created to show all of the presidents who used your blanket.”  
Elise always had a basin of cold water by her side whenever she sat with her son. Very early on she learned that the coolness of the cloth would help quiet the pain in his head. It was her greatest joy to moisten the cloth keeping it cold throughout her story. The little boy’s head still throbbed, but while his mom was telling the story she would gently wipe his forehead with the cold cloth, and it was almost as if he forgot the pain for a time. If all went well, he would fall asleep listening to the tale of his blanket, as sleep was becoming his only relief from the pain.
“Did you know your blanket went to the moon?” Elise asked one day when her son seemed particularly down. “Neil Armstrong may have been the first man to set foot on the moon, but he laid out your quilt so he and Buzz Aldrin could have a picnic.” 
The idea of two astronauts having a picnic on the moon resulted in spontaneous laughter for both mother and son. 
“Is Buzz Lightyear named after Buzz Aldrin?” he asked his mom, as both continued to laugh.
“As a matter of fact he was,” Elise replied with a smile. “If you must know, Buzz Aldrin presented your quilt to Buzz Lightyear as a gift which means your blanket has been…”
“To infinity and beyond!” 
“Exactly,” Elise confirmed as she refreshed his cloth and placed it back on his head.
Day after day she would take her boy to doctors and then specialists and eventually to the hospital. Then, night after night, she would sit by his bed and tell the story of the quilt. Elise did everything she could to stretch out the story, and as each new adventure was passed from mother to son so too was hope, in the only way she knew how.  
The night that she finished the story was, in so many ways, just like most of the other nights. Elise was home in her favorite chair next to her son’s bed. Her breathing was labored and her voice unsteady. “And then I stopped by a flea market on my way home from the store and there it was, your beautiful, wonderful blanket. I knew you must have it, so I scooped it up, paid the nice woman, and brought it home to you.”
Tears filled Elise’s eyes as she sewed the last stitch on the old quilt. Holding it up, she remembered the first time her son covered himself with the blanket. I love how cool it feels when I first get into bed.
“It’s finally fixed. It’s perfect.” Elise said out loud, tears continuing to flow. “I love how cool it feels, too.” 
Summoning every bit of her strength, she lay the beloved blanket on the empty bed in front of her. 
Being a mom is a job that is never truly finished, at least she had hoped so. With nothing else left to do for her son, she sat back in the chair and silently sobbed. "
Write me a detailed and long bedtime story,"Yesterday something happened.
Don’t panic - it’s not a big deal. 
You might even laugh about this later. 
You might have noticed that the water from your tap tasted a little different this morning. Did you notice? Don’t be alarmed. Let me take a guess though; you’ve consumed at least one sip of water from your tap today? More specifically, since 2.17 this morning? 
It might have been a coffee. It might have been bubbling around a creamy pot of home brand oats. Maybe you suckled it down, latching onto that refreshing glass rim, consuming a morning pill. We all do it.
We all drink water; but today was different.
Let me prove it to you.

“Are you guys reading this?” Jordan tapped her nails across her phone screen. The sound softly filled the room. 
“Mhmm,” Kate nodded, her purple curls bouncing around the top of her head. 
“I can’t read this anymore.” Belinda pulled her chin into her neck and pushed her laptop away. She stood up dramatically and announced that it was time for her coffee. 
“But we can’t use the water!” Kate threw her arms up, “it specifically says.” 
Belinda raised an eyebrow as she continued walking past the desks. Jordan had developed a deep frown. Kate began to bounce in her chair with anxiety. They had been working so hard to get through all these short stories in time, and yet this one story had them stopped in their tracks. 
-
Oh, you’re still reading. Good. 
You’ll notice that your feet are feeling slightly tingly. You can try to ignore it; you can try to focus on something else. Maybe you can stop reading this page right now. Try to consume the words of some other poor writer, attempting to impress the brilliant minds I’ve targeted, go on.
Or you can notice the sensation in your feet. 
It all starts in the toes. That fuzzy sensation that leaves you wondering – have I been sitting weird? Is it my back pain possibly causing the nerves to shoot off little prickly vibrations in my feet? Is there a draft sweeping through the room somehow targeting only my soles? 
No, no, no, my sweet. It is so much more than that, and it is only beginning. 
-
“I’m ba-aaack,” Belinda sung delightfully, “I have the wakey juice and ready to keep it going.” 
“I couldn’t read anything this whole time.” Kate plunged her forehead against the desk and groaned loudly. Belinda straightened the tinsel draped across the back end of her chair and sat down. She ignored Kate. She also ignored the story that was clearly written by some know-it-all prankster. 
Jordan continued to frown as her eyes moved across the page. 
-
So, what is this all about? What did I – a simple witch of your neighbourhood – do to your water supply? Oh, it’s funny - laugh out loud funny if you will. A few drops of this, and few sprinkles of that. My mixture bubbled below my bed for three weeks of putrid pleasure, until it turned sweet. 
The sweet scent of pleasure filled my room on Wednesday morning. 
Thursday night I had it skilfully injected into your plumbing. 
Yes.
YOUR plumbing.
Putrid plumbing pleasures 
Bubble Below n Beyond 
The tingly toes that turn 
Are weakened by the witch’s pond 
-
“Guys,” Jordan murmured at first, “guys I think this is legit.” 
“No, it’s not.” Belinda rolled her eyes, “what did they ask for? Money? Is it blackmail again?” 
Jordan was certain that she’d understood the very last paragraph correctly. She slammed her laptop shut. The tightness in her throat gripped her. It became hard to speak. It became hard to think. It wasn’t blackmail, not at all. 
-
So, which one of you is my Jordan? Your name is irrelevant, but your acceptance of truth is the same. Let me tell you a story about the little boy who drank from the witch’s pond. His toes tingled and his soles burned. He consumed only a single sip – and this was all that it took. 
He went to sleep that night, completing his usual routine. He brushed his teeth; he combed his hair. The wooden floorboards creaked as he neared the edge of his bed and then leaned down habitually. His hand smoothed underneath his tattered mattress and the stolen gems poked back at his fingers. 
One, two, three – he would count them out – then hop into his bed dropping off into slumber. Those gems he protected with his life, sharing with none. Stolen from his brother, who died shortly after - of the plague. If only they could have afforded a doctor! The family exclaimed. Yet the gems remained tucked away. 
“One, two, three.” The witch gave a giggle, counting his toes out while he slept. “Wakey-wakey little toe boy.” 
He could shake his head and pull at the sheets – yet his eyes shot open in defeat. He noticed something strange. He could not lift his arms and could not move his legs. He was frozen in place, completely paralysed, but not quiet dead. 
“Tic Tac Toe,” the husky tone of the old hag sounded, “who’s my weak little boy with the paralysing toes?” She gasped playfully, her hook nose sniffing the air, “Oh no, little Joe, I’m going to GET you there!” 
“W-what’s happening?” The boy trembled with eyes darting in all directions, “W-why can’t I”- 
“Move?” The witch finished his sentence for him. “Oh, dear child, you drank a drip of the wicked sip and now your toes are mine.” 
“What?” The boy dribbled confusion. 
“So long as you live, if ever a witch catches you by the toe… you will be stuck, and you will freeze.” She held his big toe, so tight he yelped. The clapping of her shoes travelled towards the side of his bed. “Oh, and if you are caught by not one but TWO witches… dear oh dear, whatever will you do?” 
She reached up and tickled his knee – forcing a pained laugh and plea for release. The hag licked her lips and cackled skyward. Her leg swung over the bed, and she let herself be saddled atop his shins. That toe grip unyielding at first, she tutted before she spoke, “let’s see how ticklish these little toes can be for a wicked old witch shall we?” 
Her nails scratched and stroked those toes mercilessly. Milliseconds of movement were gifted back to the boy as her fingers lifted and clawed and lifted and clawed. The laughter emanating from the boy came in boughs. Tears dripped down the sides of his humiliatingly-fear-filled-cheeks. 
For every helpless whimper the boy shrieked, the witch felt her body respond. Oh yes, she was younger. Oh yes, every giggle and bark removed a wrinkle and tightened her grip. Mmm, the sound of each note turning back the clock was delicious to her. 
“Oh, I do love getting toned.” She felt the last stroke of youth overcome her before dashing quickly out the door. The boy regained motion and pulled his legs up tightly to his chest, shaking all over from what had just occurred. He was shamefully distressed, what magic was this? 
Little did he know that the witch would return night after night. Catching him by the toe, retaining that youth which would sweep away as the hours ticked by. Night after endless night, somehow finding him no matter how strategically he hid. His whole life feeding the witch, and who knew that laughter was a witch’s best medicine?  
-
“I’m going home,” Jordan gulped, noticing her toes were still tingling oddly at the thought. 
“Okay,” Belinda approved, “did you finish that story?” 
“Yes.” 
“Do we all need to read it?” Kate made a scared look, feeling creeped, “let’s just say we did? Bel?” 
Belinda considered for a moment, “I really like this other submission, it had a potion that gave everyone super confidence and the characters were pretty funny.” 
“Jordan?” Kate looked over at her co-worker for further input. 
“I think this one is the winner, but if you two decide otherwise that’s okay. I don’t feel well.” She left the room suddenly. Belinda and Kate exchanged glances. 
“Well, that settles it,” Kate shivered, “I am NOT reading that story. My vote goes to the confidence potion thingy.”  
“Alright that’s the decision then.” Belinda turned her computer off and began to pack her bag. Both girls left the office, glad to note it was Friday and the weekend was theirs. 
-
Except it wasn’t theirs. 
Only by a gift of value – a prize, a gem, a treasure – will a witch release you from a potion of putrid proportions. 
Jordan, my Jordan, the one who read until the end. The one, whose name does not truly matter, offered a prize and would be free. 
All else who refuse, or deny this notion, just ask yourself are those toes tingling from my potion? Be warned! You may not have died, and blackmail is for mortals and scum. 
Curl your toes my sweet. I’ll be seeing you, 
Tonight will be fun. "
Write me a detailed and long bedtime story,"Dear people of the Future,
Before we get started I must let you know that whenever you open the letter and read it, take the crystal and hold it in your hand flat and which ever side of it glows is where the magic power plant is. I was not able to finish the job but maybe you can.
I’m not sure when you will find this letter, but hopefully soon.
You have all heard tales of witches, wizards, warlocks and such. And I’m sure many have wondered or wished about it being real.
You might think, ‘oh how I wish this was true’ or ‘what if its true and we don’t know it?’ And I definitely know some of you who think it’s crazy people could ever believe in such ridiculous stories. And those of you who are relating to this are probably thinking.
Great another ‘magic is real story and are about to go read a different one’, but wait! You have another thing coming!
They are all fake.
Shocking right? (Depends on who you are)
Well get ready to hear this! They tell all the stories wrong, there’s magic, but they TELL IT WRONG!!! They do it to fit what they want to believe! They do it to make it seem as if nothing bad has ever happened and make it seem good! Well guess what!? IT’S ALL A LIE!
First let me tell you what real magic is! It gets powered with emotion. (not surprising) But you can’t just do things like telekinesis, without reason. Like wanting to grab a book because you’re lazy. It won’t work no matter how hard you try.
It’s also not random. It’s only one thing. You can control elements. Fire, water wind and earth and that’s it, but don’t think we do this by ourselves. Let me explain.
Lets take Harry Potter. Great movie. Great book. It’s all good, just completely fake!
Harry Potter was this kid I went to school with! We were in Biology class together and don’t think I am about to tell you, in a school for magic or witchcraft!
It was a regular school. Just like any other.
Now here comes the part everyone is waiting for! Magic. Ya, it’s not what it seems.
There’s no wand.
There’s no potion.
There’s not wings or any of that stuff.
And if your thinking that I just described magic, well you’re wrong. Magic comes from animals for Pete’s sake!
Magic animals are a thing. Now here comes the part that might be familiar.
They are all pretty much evil. Just like humans. So that story of the Whopping Willow, is a dead animal. All animals, when they die, take the place of a plant with some extra thing to it. Also for extra information, the Whopping Willow was a dead evil owl.
Now one last thing about animals. The only good and kind animal is the…
PIG! Ya, not really exiting, but true, so when you see Harry’s pet owl, know it was actually meant to be a pig.
Onto how humans have powers. See, like I said earlier, humans are also greedy.
So with science being really good back then, and only for a little while thanks to SOME PEOPLE (*Cough Cough* Harry Potter), we found a way to steal magic from animals. Of course, I don’t think it was necessarily right, and we would still be doing it, if Harry hadn’t blown up the last of the supplies to get the magic, when he tripped of that wire.
Now the reality of the magic community and my story.
I was born in the 2000 and magic was open, so one could not believe it because it was around them all the time, or at least that’s what I thought.
All the science powered stuff is actually powered by magic. Not with humans magic of course, but with animals! They just use them. They do this at the power plant I mentioned earlier. I’ll explain later why I haven’t stopped them.
People have magic now because it was in our ancestors DNA and it’s gotten passed down like any other trait, sometimes skipping people.
Everyone thinks America is great right! Well that’s because we have more privileges other country’s don’t have, so really it’s just better, not good. (I think it’s totally unfair, but anyway!) People either think we have a bad president or a good one, can’t be in between. People always fighting about things, whether right or wrong is not what I’m getting into.
What I’m getting into is that they start with someone working for the government. They purposely make mistakes! Stupid right?!
The reason they do this is simple. Magic should rule and once it’s time they will. Telling people now will only get out planned wrecked. Also forcing animals to work would get them in trouble too.
So, let’s go back to history when George Washington said not to split the government. Well, now that people have the freedom to press and speech, they have to make bigger problems to cover it up, and if they ever find out they could just say. “Wasn’t important right now.”
Don’t get me wrong, I would love to go and tell everyone this. It would be a lot better, but then the government said he would erase everyone’s memory of it and even threatened random people.
Now you might be thinking, bro just hide it, but that’s not how this works! You think science is good, well imagine it combined wit magic and it’s complete trouble.
When you accidentally get powers, like myself (story for another time), they put a tracker on you and watch you from every device. I tried to tell someone once and I barely got off with a warning.
Hopefully this story will convince you magic is real and not in the way you thought. I need people who will do what right even when it’s hard. I want you to treat the people that are jerks to you as kind as you can. I want you to not get caught up in the bad things because that’s how they use people. Focus on the good things in life because people remember that and it will change bad thoughts to good ones. Even if you never find out how or where or anything about magic, just do what you can to change lives in a good way, and you will end up working together to stop this.
(Also I am writing this in my bookstore. If it’s still here than know that the bottom locked drawer’s key is in the closet in the box labeled junk and when you open the bottom door you’ll find the very last bottle of homemade ice cream.) "
