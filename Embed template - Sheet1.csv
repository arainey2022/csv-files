"Selling the dream is a key part of a founder’s job, whether that means convincing investors to invest, prospects to buy, or candidates to join the company. Existing relationships can be a big advantage, but when you’re just starting up, outbound prospecting is crucial in expanding your network and building new relationships.
The most common approach to prospecting is intuitive: reach out, see what happens, and repeat. You soon learn it’s a numbers game: speak to enough people and you’ll occasionally strike it lucky and close a deal — whether with a new investor, recruit, or customer.
But how can you increase those odds of striking it lucky?",Author 1,Title 1,Section 1,https://link-1.com,Img1
"Learning from sales teams
For sales teams, prospecting and closing are full-time activities. Modern, at-scale teams have outgrown the intuitive approach and engineered processes that are more likely to turn leads into sales.
Of course, not all sales leads are created equal and for our purposes here, we can put them in one of three categories:
        Inbound leads — driven by ‘marketing’ activity (ads, content, events, etc.)
        Outbound leads — driven by sales (cold emails, phone calls, etc.)
        Referred leads — driven by customers (existing customers, prospects, partners, etc.)
Inbound and referred leads have higher conversion rates but tend to be less predictable than outbound leads. On the other hand, if you’re disciplined about reaching out to potential customers who are theoretically a good fit on paper you can begin to predict sales based on conversion rates. Effective outbound sales pipelines can achieve conversion rates of 20–40%.
Many of the concepts used by prospecting teams have applications beyond sales, for example, in recruiting, marketing, and fundraising. Here are six of these concepts every founder should understand:
Structuring pipelines
Creating leads lists
Framing conversations
Building message sequences
Managing your time
Generating referrals

"In 2011, Marylou Tyler wrote a book called Predictable Revenue, known by many as ‘The Sales Bible of Silicon Valley’. Marylou describes four stages in a typical sales development pipeline:
	Cold — people who haven’t yet engaged with your business and you can reach out to
	Working — people you’re actively talking with
	Qualify — people who are actively deciding whether there’s a fit
	Sales qualified leads (SQL) — people who are a fit and want to work with you
She also describes two further buckets for those who aren’t a fit:
	Long-term follow-up — people who aren’t a fit yet, but may be in the future
	Do not contact — people who aren’t a fit

Key stages of a sales development pipeline, from Predictable Revenue.
A pipeline doesn’t just organise the status of leads, it also prescribes the next step of the process — typically, a response or a follow-up. Following up is often neglected, either for fear of ‘being too pushy’ or due to disorganised, inefficient processes. However, a well-written follow-up is often makes the difference between success and failure.
CRMs such as Pipedrive can also help, by flagging leads that don’t have a predetermined next step, so they don’t fall through the cracks.",Author 3,Title 3,Section 3,https://link-3.com,Img3
"When you have a pipeline, you need to fill it with leads, whether they’re investors, candidates, or companies. The first step is to identify your ideal customer profile (ICP) — a description of the ideal characteristics associated with the people or businesses you want to sell to. While you might have to start by making some smart assumptions, you’ll quickly learn which profiles actually respond, convert, and succeed, enabling you to update your ICP accordingly.
The more clearly you can articulate your ideal customer, the more likely it is that you’ll find them.
But finding them requires research. There are lots of places you might look, depending on what you’re selling. For example:
	Customers: LinkedIn, AngelList, directories, existing databases, your network
	Recruits: LinkedIn, your network, your existing employees
	Investors: Investor databases, founders in your network
Aside from decision-makers, you might also reach out to indirect and direct influencers, who can help you gather company-specific information or internal referrals and practice your narrative. Here’s an example of an influencer mapping for the General Partner of a VC fund.",Author 4,Title 4,Section 4,https://link-4.com,Img4
